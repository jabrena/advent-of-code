# Problem Type Classification - Advent of Code 2025

This document classifies Advent of Code 2025 problems by their primary problem type.

## Classification Categories

- **Data Processing**: Problems involving parsing, transforming, filtering, or aggregating data
- **Grid (2D Matrix)**: Problems involving 2D grid/matrix manipulation, pathfinding, or spatial operations
- **Games & Algorithms**: Problems involving game simulation, game rules, or algorithmic challenges like recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming
- **Others**: Problems that don't fit into the above categories

## Classification Table

| Day | Problem | Part 1 Type | Part 2 Type | Primary Type | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Day1 | Dial Rotator | Data Processing | Data Processing | Data Processing | Processes rotation instructions (L/R with distances), tracks dial state, counts zero crossings using modular arithmetic |
| Day2 | Invalid ID Validator | Data Processing | Data Processing | Data Processing | Processes ID ranges, validates IDs based on string patterns (repeated parts), aggregates sums |

## Summary by Type

### Data Processing
- **Day1**: Dial rotation with state tracking
- **Day2**: ID validation and range processing

### Grid (2D Matrix)
- None

### Games & Algorithms
- None

### Others
- None

## Detailed Analysis

### Day1 - Dial Rotator
**Type**: Data Processing

**Description**: 
- Processes a sequence of rotation instructions (L{distance} or R{distance})
- Tracks dial position (0-99) and counts occurrences of position 0
- Part 1: Counts times dial points at 0 after each complete rotation
- Part 2: Counts times dial points at 0 during rotations (optimized using modular arithmetic)

**Key Operations**:
- Parsing rotation strings
- State tracking (dial position)
- Modular arithmetic calculations
- Aggregation (counting zero occurrences)

**Why Data Processing**: 
- Primary focus is on processing a sequence of instructions
- State tracking is secondary to the data transformation
- No grid manipulation, game simulation, or complex recursive algorithms

### Day2 - Invalid ID Validator
**Type**: Data Processing

**Description**:
- Processes ranges of IDs (e.g., "11-22,95-115")
- Validates IDs based on string pattern rules
- Part 1: IDs must have even length and be made of two equal parts
- Part 2: IDs must be composed of repeated equal parts of any length

**Key Operations**:
- Parsing range strings
- Generating IDs from ranges
- String pattern matching and validation
- Filtering and aggregation (summing invalid IDs)

**Why Data Processing**:
- Primary focus is on processing and validating data (IDs)
- String manipulation and pattern matching are data transformation operations
- No grid structures, game mechanics, or recursive algorithms
